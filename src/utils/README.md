# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility functions and helper code:

## Examples

- `dateUtils.js` - Date formatting and manipulation
- `validationUtils.js` - Form validation helpers
- `constants.js` - Application constants
- `helpers.js` - General utility functions

## Guidelines

- Use camelCase for function names
- Export functions individually for tree-shaking
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Write unit tests for all utility functions
