# Components Directory

This directory contains all React components organized by their purpose:

## Structure

- `ui/` - Reusable UI components (buttons, modals, forms, etc.)
- `calendar/` - Calendar-specific components (event modals, date navigation, etc.)
- `layout/` - Layout components (headers, footers, navigation, etc.)

## Guidelines

- Each component should have its own directory with index.js/jsx and styles
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Include PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
- Add unit tests for complex components
