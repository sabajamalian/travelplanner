   - Event type in use (cannot delete)
   - Database errors

5. Test soft delete functionality
6. Verify record still exists in database
```

   - Set deleted_at = NULL
   - Set updated_at = NOW()

3. Response format:
   ```json
   {

   - Gone errors (410) for deleted items
   - Conflict errors (409) for duplicate names
   - Database errors (500)
   - Proper error messages

3. Add category validation:

   - Test database setup
   - Test data initialization
   - Route testing utilities

2. Test all endpoints:
   - GET / - list active event types
   - GET /deleted - list deleted event types
   - POST / - create event type
   - GET /:id - get single event type
   - PUT /:id - update event type
   - DELETE /:id - soft delete event type
   - POST /:id/restore - restore event type

3. Test error scenarios:
   - Invalid input data
   - Missing required fields
   - Non-existent IDs
   - Database errors
   - Validation failures
   - Duplicate names
   - In-use event types

4. Test soft delete functionality:
   - Verify records are marked deleted
   - Verify records can be restored
   - Verify deleted records don't appear in active list
   - Test deletion of in-use types

5. Test event type-specific features:
   - Color validation
